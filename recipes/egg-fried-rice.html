    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Egg Fried Rice is a simple yet flavorful dish made by stir-frying day-old rice with scrambled eggs, garlic, and vegetables, then seasoning it with soy sauce, white pepper, and sesame oil. The high heat of the wok creates a light, fluffy texture, while the eggs coat each grain of rice, adding richness and depth of flavor. Quick to prepare and endlessly customizable, this dish is a staple in Chinese households, 
        often enjoyed as a standalone meal or as a complement to other dishes.</p>
